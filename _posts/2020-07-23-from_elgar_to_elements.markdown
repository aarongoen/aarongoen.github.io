As I embark upon my journey into the field of software engineering, I hear the bracing strains of Edward Elgar’s Pomp and Circumstance #1 march in my head. You know, Edward Elgar, the composer of THE graduation march for high schools and universities? As a professional musician and a fan of Elgar, I thought naming my first blog post after him and my current course of study, including HTML elements, would be apropo. I feel as if I am graduating from one career/chapter in my life and beginning my travels to another. But how did I get here?

Why would a classically-trained, graduate-degreed church organist want to learn how to code? For me, after having worked decades in the church and school environments, I have reached a plateau in my career. Nonprofits like the ones I have worked with often lack the funds to provide a salary to support a family. This, compounded with the fact that I live in one of the most expensive areas of the country, Washington, DC, led me to consider other career choices. While I love what I do, I want to be able to provide for my daughter and spouse, and be to able to spend time with them. 

So, why coding? There are a number of other careers out there. Well, I’m not a twenty or thirty-something anymore. I am still paying off student loans. I don’t have the time or the means to fork over a huge stack of money for another two to four years of college. Since an entry-level software development career doesn’t need a college degree, and many of the coding schools’ programs range from 6 months to two years, I thought learning this way would be a quick and effective way to start a new career. 

Also, I love to create. I love to hear a piece that I've arranged performed and experience how something I've crafted sounds like in real life. Likewise, I have enjoyed automating repetitive tasks, like creating 7-day block schedule templates that populate my Google calendar for school, and pay-calculators for musicians at church. Secondly, there is a demand for software engineers. I look forward to having job opportunities all around the country as opposed to the scant number of desirable church musician jobs. Thirdly, and most importantly, I want to be able to spend time with my family. Someone in the line of church work is most active when the “nine-to-fivers” are off. So, since my spouse works a more traditional schedule, I decided it would be best for us to have similar schedules so we could optimize our family time. 

How did I choose the Flatiron School? As a new father, I was looking for a part-time program where I could work and still spend time with my daughter. I was also looking for a school that had an income share agreement. This way, I could work part-time, and be able to continue to afford to live in the expensive Washington, DC area. I was also looking for a program that had a good mentoring program, job placement services, and track record. 

So, with the hope for a better work-family balance, better pay, and the gratification of being able to build things, I begin my studies at the Flatiron School. I look forward to learning many new things, meeting new people, and contributing to the field of software development.
